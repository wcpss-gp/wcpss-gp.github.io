From Mansa Musa to the Ottoman rulers, Islam was at the core of the empires. Society was distributed by socioeconomic factors with a wide range of professions. Larger, mor established empires were relatively peacefule, while prospective ones, less so.

                                Mansa Musa, a Muslim, made a pilgrimage to Mecca. As a result of this journey, Mansa Musa would be widely known for his wealth and the Mali Empire for its power and size. Mansa Musa travelled with tens of thousands of people and dozens of camels, each carrying 300 pounds of gold. Mansa Musa then distributed the gold to people he saw on his journey, causing the price of gold to drop in Egypt for a while.

                                The Barbary Slave Trade was a organized slave capturing operation by Barbary pirates who captured slaves to sell in the Arab slave markets in North Africa. Not only were Africans captured by the priates, European men and women (mostly English) were also taken. European leaders tried unsuccessfully to stop the pirates, but resorted to ransom payments. The priates, though, continued to capture Africans.

In addition, fighting between the Algerians and the French allowed for some tribes along the Algerian border to break away, causing more problems for France.

                                At the time, North Africa was controlled by European powers. European colonialism changed many aspects of society in North Africa. From Europeans demanding more resources from the colonies, to lack of societal autonomy, North Africa was in the hands of Europe and its people were ont happy. Nationalist movements had begun against the colonizers, but non would bear fruit till much later. Local leaders would break away from European controlled territories and start their own tribes, whose support would be critical for Europeans to gain control of North Africa.

                                The Senussi War was a military conflict between the Senussi and Britain. The Senussi were a relatively peaceful religious sect of the Sahara Dessert who were friendly with the British in Egypt. The Turks persuaded the Senussi to attack Britain. The result was a loss for the Senussi and a change in leadership. The war gave Britain more territory around Egypt, which enabled them to have multiple successes in the WWI North African Theater.

The British had establishments in Egypt, so the Ottoman Empire was afraid as present-day Turkey, their homeland, was near by. Regarding the governmental situation, colonies in North Africa were still present, but tribes and small nations started to form. These small nations either were peaceful, allied with a WWI power, or were warring for territory.

The battles were primarily fought by Britain and France vs Germany and Italy. If the Allies controlled North Africa, Italy was easy to target.

Society was not progressing, rather, people were more focused on either their safety or the victory of their tribe and European partner. Colonies were mostly gone, but the borders drawn by the Europeans caused hostilities between tribal neighbors.

The cost and lack of political will in the war resulted in a victory for the Algerians. Most of the war was fought in harsh terrain and poor conditions. The civillian deaths were also high as both sides targeted cities and towns.

                                The economic state of the world at this time was substandard as WWII had just finsihed. European powers lost their military and financial power, which led colonies to rebel and seek freedom. This was especially true in North Africa as many regions were controlled or affiliated to an European power. Due to these connections, the general population formed rebel groups to fight against oppressing tribes or nations. The social state, like WWII, was fight or flight, without much progress in any field.
